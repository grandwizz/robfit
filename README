This repo contains the original 1991 FORTRAN files for the ROBFIT spectral analysis code 
which was developed by myself and Bob Coldwell while I was working at the UNiversity of Florida.

I will be adding files - as I find them - with a view to helping me back into some form of coding.

Mind you I have struggled getting onto GitHub so I may not last the course ;)
